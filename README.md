Example Unity 4.x project demonstrating Playstation DualShock 3 input, linear color interpolation, particle and trail effects and audio.

Controls
--------
| Action | Result |
| :----: | :----: |
| Square | Cube Color |
| X | Ground Color |
| Triangle | Sky Color |
| Circle | Light Color |
| R1 | Zoom In |
| L1 | Zoom Out |
| R2 | Toggle Trail Renderer |
| L2 | Toggle Particle System |
| Left Analog Stick | Move Cube |
| Right Analog Stick | Move Camera |

An easter egg is triggered with the Konami code (substitute B for X and A for Circle).

Input Mapping
--------------
The input manager is mapped to accommodate a Playstation DualShock 3 controller on a Mac.  Be sure to substitute the [appropriate button mapping](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/89288-PS3-Button-Map) when running the project in Windows.  The project can also be re-mapped for use with an [Xbox 360 controller](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Xbox360Controller), among others.
